# JavaScript Loose Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in JavaScript related to loose comparisons (==) with null and undefined values. The `foo` function attempts to distinguish between null, undefined, and other values. However, due to JavaScript's loose comparison rules, this approach might lead to incorrect results when dealing with falsy values like 0 or false.

## Bug Description
The `foo` function uses loose equality (==) which can lead to unexpected results when comparing falsy values to null or undefined. The problem is that loose comparison does not correctly differentiate between these values and other falsy values.
